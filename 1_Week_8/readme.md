### Dataset

In this homework, we'll build a model for predicting if we have an image of a bee or a wasp. 
For this, we will use the "Bee or Wasp?" dataset that was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerzydziewierz/bee-vs-wasp) and slightly rebuilt. 

You can download the dataset for this homework from [here](https://github.com/SVizor42/ML_Zoomcamp/releases/download/bee-wasp-data/data.zip):

```bash
wget https://github.com/SVizor42/ML_Zoomcamp/releases/download/bee-wasp-data/data.zip
