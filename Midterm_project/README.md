# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2023 - Midterm project 

## GOAL : Predict heart attack 

This is my first ML project and I used a dataset to train a model with the goal of predic the heart attack probability.
/nI find a dataset in kaggle for this pourpose :

#### Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset/data

Data
You should either commit the dataset you used or have clear instructions how to download the dataset
Notebook (suggested name - notebook.ipynb) with
Data preparation and data cleaning
EDA, feature importance analysis
Model selection process and parameter tuning
Script train.py (suggested name)
Training the final model
Saving it to a file (e.g. pickle) or saving it with specialized software (BentoML)
Script predict.py (suggested name)
Loading the model
Serving it via a web service (with Flask or specialized software - BentoML, KServe, etc)
Files with dependencies
Pipenv and Pipenv.lock if you use Pipenv
or equivalents: conda environment file, requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
Dockerfile for running the service
